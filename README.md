# Choices
Technical challenge Android

I approached this challenge by first studying the flow chart andUI mockups. I then divided the scope of work into 5 layers:
A. UI Design
B. Data Modelling
C. Component creation and binding UI to Data.
D. Testing and debugging.
E. Publishing and Documentation.

Due to lack of Choices content, i had to improvise. I also utilized Parse.com as my dummy REST API/datasource. 
The MODEL for the data has 5 fields: 
1. MainTitle - This is the primary title of a particular task. It was assumed that all titles are unique in this workflow.
2. ID - This is the Primary Key for a particular task. It is also assumed to be unique per record.
3. Description: This is the entire content description. 
4. Image - This is the image URL for a particular task.
5. Duration - Duration of task completion.
6. SectionA - This is a breakdown of content for 1st Textfield on the instructions page
7. SectionB - Breakdown of remaining content for 2nd Textfield on instructions page

For future considerations i will recommmend a BAAS platform for quicker integration and ease of maintenance
